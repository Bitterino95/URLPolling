# URLPolling

This repo is made for a trivial little project for a *Quora answer*. 
The answer is written in **italian** at this [link](http://bit.ly/2GmJg2l).
This code is **not fully tested** and has the aim to continously poll a web page and storing a value in a specific HTML tag into a MySQL table.
It is just a Java funny excercise.

I hope it could be useful for you as a baseline code for your project.
Bye!
